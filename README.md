# Stop-Computing-And-Start-Investing

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to analyze when --
while predicting the future price of a financial instrument -- we
should stop computations and start using this information for the
actual investment.
	
Design/methodology/approach: We derive the explicit
formulas explaining how the resulting gain depends on the duration
of computations.

Findings: We provide an algorithm that enables us to
decide the computation time that leads to the largest possible
gain.
	
Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first solution to the problem. Following our recommendations
will allow investors to select the computation time for which the
resulting gain is the largest possible.
	
Keywords: Investment; Optimal investment portfolio; Computation time.
